# py2md

Run python code in jupyter to generate markdown reports.

Usage:

```
python -m py2md test_py2md.py
```

This will then run jupyter and generate a md file output with associated images.

Debug Usage:

```
python -m py2md test_py2md.py --debug
```

This will also print out all jupyter output to see if anything is missing from the output.
